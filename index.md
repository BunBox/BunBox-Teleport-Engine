# Documentation Under Construction

## BunBox Teleport Engine
### Introduction

Thank you for your interest in the BunBox Teleport Engine.

This site serves as documentation for the Engine, providing explanation of core features, useage in greater detail and example use cases.

### Purpose: "But what about Experience?..."

Experience is a powerful tool in Second Life that has greatly expanded is doable, but as great a thing it is, it does have some serious limitations.

-	**Paywall** - _Experience exists behind a paywall, requiring Premium to create and compile scripts that use Experience._
-	**Locked down** - _Experience scripts must be compiled to run with a specific Experience and that specific Experience must be allowed to run on land._
-	**Performance Bottleneck** - _Experience offers some great possibilities via llCreateKeyValuePair()/llReadKeyValuePair() but this requires a Dataserver response for reading and writing of data which turns this into a trade off of speed vs ease of scripting._
